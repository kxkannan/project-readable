# Readable API Server

This is my project for Udacity React/Redux course. 

The app comes up with a default set of posts and categories. You can add new post to a category or sort the posts by
Vote score or Timestamp.

You can edit a post by clicking on it and updating the title and body. Comments can be added to the post by clicking on
the post. New comments will display below the post.

Comments can be voted up or down; comments can be edited or deleted.

To start the backend server

* Install and start the backend API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
    
* In another terminal window,
   
    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm start`
